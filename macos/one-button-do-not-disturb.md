# One Button Do Not Disturb

Clicking on the Notification Pane on the top-right corner of your screen on macOS will open the Notification sidebar. The sidebar can be used to turn on/off notifications. However, during a screen sharing session, one might not want to open the sidebar just to mute the notifications.
