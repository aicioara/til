# Tmux true color

True Color for terminal emulator means supporting 24-bit colors. Terminals such as iTerm2 on macOS support that, but tmux does not out-of-the-box. At the end of this file there is a test that you can run to see whether or not your session currently supports 24-bit colors

### Enabling 24-bit colors in tmux

Add the following line to your tmux.conf

```
set -ga terminal-overrides ",xterm-256color:Tc"
```

Then save your session, run `tmux kill-server` and open tmux again.

### Test 24-bit colors

[This test](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lifepillar/09a44b8cf0f9397465614e622979107f/raw/24-bit-color.sh) should show smooth gradients. You will notice if it is not a smooth gradient.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
#   This file echoes a bunch of 24-bit color codes
#   to the terminal to demonstrate its functionality.
#   The foreground escape sequence is ^[38;2;<r>;<g>;<b>m
#   The background escape sequence is ^[48;2;<r>;<g>;<b>m
#   <r> <g> <b> range from 0 to 255 inclusive.
#   The escape sequence ^[0m returns output to default

setBackgroundColor()
{
    echo -en "\x1b[48;2;$1;$2;$3""m"
}

resetOutput()
{
    echo -en "\x1b[0m\n"
}

# Gives a color $1/255 % along HSV
# Who knows what happens when $1 is outside 0-255
# Echoes "$red $green $blue" where
# $red $green and $blue are integers
# ranging between 0 and 255 inclusive
